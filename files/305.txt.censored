As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed , we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom .  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo .  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge , please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge .  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the * * * * * and we request your patience , as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom .
